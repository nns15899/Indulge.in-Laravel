#indulge.in(a unique methodology of learning)
    Applying the Direct Method and the Communicative Approach in all our lessons, our teachers use contextual clues and
    questions to encourage students to express themselves in a facilitated conversation. Our lessons are structured in
    a way where there is equal opportunity for the student to get to know the target language and to be comfortable
    using it, progressively consolidating the students' understanding and ensure higher retention.!
